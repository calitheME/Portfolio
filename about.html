        <p>I am Calista Kirchhoff, also known as Cali, an 
        engineering student at the University of Oklahoma (OU) majoring in Mechanical
        Engineering and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. <br><br>
        In the past, I worked as an unlicensed A&P aircraft technician where I
        developed my love for aviation and hands-on work. Since then, I have joined
        AIAA's (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) DBF (Design, Build, Fly)
        team at OU, where I am continuing this journey. I also had the opportunity to attend
        SCR's (Sooner Competitive Robotics) onboarding and plan to continue working with 
        them in the future.<br><br>During summer of 2025, ONEOK brought me in as a first-time
        intern. Through that experience, it became clear that there is still so much to learn.
        Today, I am striving to learn the technical skills that I believe will help me help you 
        next summer, 2026. This website is allowing me to show my progress. Feel free to save
        URL to follow along.</p>

        <h4>Not Engineering Related</h4>
        <p>Outside of my professional life, I am still a learner, that doesn't change. However,
        I do learn rather diverse hobbies. Below is a list of some of my hobbies in order of the most 
        frequently revisited to the least:
        <ol>
            <li>Language Learning</li>
            <li>Weight Lifting & Running</li>
            <li>Skateboarding</li>
            <li>Art (Physical/Digital)</li>
            <li>Musical Instruments (Piano/Guitar)</li>
            <li>Indoor Rock Climbing</li>
            <li>Creative Writing</li>
            <li>Thrift Flipping (Furniture/Clothes)</li>
            
        </ol>
        I am engaged to a veteran, Joseph Wisniewski, who is often accompanying me with the more dangerous 
        hobbies listed above. If you were to see us out and about, we would be with our two blue-heeler mixes
         Myla Blue and Hardy Beartooth.
