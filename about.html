            <h4>Engineering Related</h4>
            <p>I am Calista Kirchhoff, also known as Cali, an 
            engineering student at the University of Oklahoma (OU) majoring in Mechanical
            Engineering and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. <br><br>
            In the past, I worked as an unlicensed A&P aircraft technician where I
            developed my love for aviation and hands-on work. Since then, I have joined
            AIAA's (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) DBF (Design, Build, Fly)
            team at OU, where I am continuing this journey. I also had the opportunity to attend
            SCR's (Sooner Competitive Robotics) onboarding and plan to continue working with 
            them in the future.<br><br>During summer of 2025, ONEOK brought me in as a first-time
            intern. Through that experience, it became clear that there is still so much to learn.
            Today, I am striving to learn the technical skills that I believe will help me help you 
            next summer, 2026. This website is allowing me to show my progress. Feel free to save
            URL to follow along.</p>
            <h4>Not Engineering Related</h4>
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I am still a learner, that doesn't change. However,
            I do learn rather diverse hobbies. Below is a list of some of my hobbies in order of the most 
            frequently revisited to the least:
            <ol>
                <li>Language Learning</li>
                <li>Weight Lifting & Running</li>
                <li>Skateboarding</li>
                <li>Art (Physical/Digital)</li>
                <li>Musical Instruments (Piano/Guitar)</li>
                <li>Indoor Rock Climbing</li>
                <li>Creative Writing</li>
                <li>Thrift Flipping (Furniture/Clothes)</li>
                
            </ol>
            I am engaged to a Marine Corps veteran, Joseph Wisniewski, who is often accompanying me with the more dangerous 
            hobbies listed above. If you were to see us out and about, we would be with our two blue-heeler mixes
            Myla Blue and Hardy Beartooth.
